    Return how many starters the team still needs to fill by bucket, plus FLEX capacity.

    Logic:
      1) Count ACTIVE roster slots by bucket.
      2) Allocate toward PRIMARY buckets first (capped by requirement).
      3) Any surplus beyond primary requirements can count toward FLEX (up to 2).
      4) Report 'need' vs 'got' for each primary bucket and FLEX.

    Notes:
      - We don't track explicit "this slot is FLEX" â€” we infer FLEX fill by surplus starters.
      - If an active slot has bucket=None, it is ignored (won't count toward primary or FLEX).
      - The endpoint also returns helpful summary totals.
